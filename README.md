## Title

Team Generator

## Description

This project is aimed to support project managers with quickly building out team profiles for their projects.

## Installation

This application utilizes the npm “inquirer” and "jest" as its main installation. This allows us to ask questions and receive user inputs for our specific program.

## Usage

My hope is that this can be used by project managers and other professionals who wish to optimize their days and save precious time quickly generate team profiles. The application was meant to be robust to ensure that (hopefully) the application would meet the potential users needs. 

## Contribute

I do encourage anyone to go ahead and contribute to this code. I am certain there are other needs for other individuals that I have yet to think of at this time.

## Test

You will be able to test this application by cloning it and installing npm “inquirer” (and 'jest' if you wish to test the test.js files). You may use most any text editor that can work on JS. Currently I am using VS Code.

## Contact

Feel free to reach me here for any suggestions or questions in regards to this application.
